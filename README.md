## Hi there 👋
I’m a Data Scientist & AI/ML Researcher with extensive experience building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models in real-world production environments. I love working on computer vision, NLP, LLMs, Generative AI, and multimodal AI, and I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights that improve accuracy and reduce costs. I’m experienced in MLOps, cloud deployment (AWS), statistical modeling, and A/B testing, and I enjoy leading cross-functional AI teams to deliver real business impact. When I’m not coding or researching, I’m usually exploring new AI technologies and publishing my findings in top-tier journals. You can find my published research and data science projects on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIBmNbsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

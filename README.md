## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a data scientist and research scientist with a Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from Arizona State University. My expertise lies in applying machine learning and geospatial data analysis to solve real-world challenges. I specialize in working with remote sensing data, such as radar, LiDAR, and satellite imagery, and transforming raw datasets into actionable insights through the development of robust and scalable machine learning pipelines. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve built and deployed end-to-end AI solutions using tools like Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch as well as geospatial platforms like QGIS and Google Earth Engine. I enjoy both doing research and building practical tools, whether it's cleaning and organizing large datasets, creating deep learning models, or showing the results in a clear way to others. My ability to move fluidly between high-level problem solving and detailed coding work allows me to deliver both innovative and practical solutions. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on developing AI-driven systems for infrastructure health monitoring, detecting water leaks, analyzing vegetation encroachment near power lines, and assessing environmental data for sustainable urban systems. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in keeping up with the latest advances in AI and deep learning, and I make it a daily habit to learn something new in this fast-moving field. Iâ€™m always open to new collaborations, especially those involving research-based data science projects. Please explore some of the work Iâ€™ve done here on GitHub to learn more about my interests.
